12ball
======

solves problem: given 12 indistinguishable balls, where 11 are exactly the same, and 1 is either slightly heavier or slightly lighter, how many weighings on a scale does it take to determine which ball is the different one, and whether it is heavier or lighter.

notes:
- uses node.js
- uses "fibers" module (npm install fibers)
- takes about 30 seconds to run
